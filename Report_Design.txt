1)	Data structures:
a.	Linked lists – To hold all the token values until the end
b.  Array - To store the current token. *This could be a linked list

2)	Functions
Tokenizer function – Takes in what state we are currently at, takes in the current character we are at, takes in the current token. [ie. Tokenizer(16, n, "Toke")]. in the function we can do if/else statments that will determine it's new state and continue to the next character.

3) Pseudocode

Tokenizer(int state, char character, char token[])
