How to run the scanner:

1) If the Scanner.cpp is not already complied there won't be a Scanner.exe in the file
If there isn't a Scanner.exe:
	1. First make sure a g++ library is installed on this device.
	2. Open up the command prompt(cmd) on your computer
	3. Move the location on cmd to where the Scanner.cpp is located (ie. 'cd C:/users/ryan/Scanner')
	4. Compile Scanner.cpp
		'g++ Scanner.cpp -o Scanner'
2) Make sure command prompt(cmd) is open and run the Scanner.exe with the only argument being the .txt file
	ie. 'Scanner Test_1.txt'
